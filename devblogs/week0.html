                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I've always loved grapple mechanics, and have implemented a couple of "cheesy" grapples in the past, similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPjuTK91MA8" target="_blank">this one</a> by Dave Game Development on YouTube. However, these "cheesy" grapples have limitations - they're often done by adding a joint component between the player and the anchor point and then drawing in a line between the two, so there is never any actual rope between the two objects that may cause whiplash. Similarly, "bungee" type movements caused by rope elasticity are limited to the joint type, and using a joint with elasticity can leave less control for swinging and vice versa. In other "cheesy" methods of making grapples, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_20OrE-AR8" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> by Ryan Laley on YouTube or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYzZsBl3OI0" target="_blank">this one</a> by Dave Game Development on YouTube, there isn't even a joint to begin with - there is only an added force on the player in the direction towards or around the anchor point. For all of these "cheesy" implementations, the line between the player and the anchor is always kept entirely straight, rather than curving with the momentum of a swing or etc.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When people look to make a grapple/swing mechanic that truly does have a rope-type object between the player and the anchor, one thing that is tried often is to create a set of points that make up the rope and then add joint components between all of those points, similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4YCj4Tid0w" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> by World of Zero on YouTube. This is essentially taking the "cheesy" method and iterating it. Or, for those using Unreal, there is a <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Components/CableComponent/" target="_blank">Cable Component plugin</a> made by Unreal that can be used starting in version 4.14 and forward.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">However, these are more "easy" solutions to a problem I'd like to explore as an educational challenge, so for this project the constraints between points in the grapple rope will be manually calculated. This will be done using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration" target="_blank">Verlet Integration</a> alongside the Jakobsen method of stick constraints, which is a set of methods of imposing distance constraints on a set of points that all have their own velocities. This has been used many times for rope simulations - it's in fact what Unreal used for the Cable Component plug in mentioned earlier, and what Hitman: Codename 47 used for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618020250/http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm" target="_blank">cloth, plant, and ragdoll simulations.</a> This last resource is important, as it was the paper that introduced the Jakobsen method, and has been used by several people to make grapple ropes that are similar to my own goals, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/gs4ldr/2d_rope_physicsgrappling_hook_examplepapers/" target="_blank">raineezy</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/gs4ldr/comment/ji206x1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" target="_blank">cotandbold</a> from Reddit. Their projects were 2D and used Godot, but the principals are similar.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">To solve the problem of the rope visual looking curved rather than the standard straight edged line between points, I will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation" target="_blank">polynomial interpolation</a> to create the visual line.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Listed Project Goals:</h4>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            <ul>
                                <li class="fs-5">The project will be a 3D first person playground in Unreal 5.1 where the grapple may be experimented with.</li>
                                <li class="fs-5">The player can anchor on large or stationary objects they can swing around or pull themselves towards (or drop themselves from, by letting out the rope even more).</li>
                                <li class="fs-5">The player can grapple smaller/moveable objects they can pull towards themselves.</li>
                                <li class="fs-5">When the player falls and gets caught by the rope of the grapple, the rope should display some elasticity.</li>
                                <li class="fs-5">When the player grabs a moveable object with the grapple gun, the object should react to the force of the grapple.</li>
                                <li class="fs-5">When the points that make up the rope of the grapple are not in a straight line, the visuals should represent a smoothly curved rope.</li>
                                <li class="fs-5">Anchor decisions will be made via simple raycast; physics simulation will not begin until the player has already anchored the grapple.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
