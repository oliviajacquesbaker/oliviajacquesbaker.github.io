                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before beginning to make the points behave as a rope with constrainted distances between each segment, the individual points had to be simulated. There are two reasons to do this manually rather than using Unreal's systems: improved control and stability. Manual control of the physics of an object allows us to separate things such as the gravitational force acting on that object versus the rest of the Unreal-controlled scene, which is useful for creating a simulation where the "feel" of the result is very important. More important, however, is the note about stability.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For accurate but fast non-continuous physics simulations, game developers usually choose either Euler Integration or Verlet Integration. Both are reasonably accurate approximations, but Verlet is more numerically stable. With Euler's method, you consider position and velocity largely seperately; you update velocity using acceleration and delta time, and then update position with velocity and delta time. Updating these two values seperately introduces more opportunity for the energy in the system to rise or fall, depending on if you are using the implicit or explicit method of integration. Verlet Integration stabilizes the simulation by removing velocity as a separate calculation and instead storing the previous position.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This is not a new or uncommon method of simulation, and there are folks who explain this much better than I can - personally I found <a href="https://pikuma.com/blog/verlet-integration-2d-cloth-physics-simulation" target="_blank">the PIKUMA course</a> on this topic especially useful - but the general idea is that you can get an accurate representation of velocity simply by subtracting your previous position from your current one, and then your new position becomes <code>position<sub>new</sub> = 2*position - position<sub>old</sub> + acceleration * delta time * delta time</code>, where the acceleration is whatever force you have divided by the mass of the object.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I used this method to get the points on the rope simulating, and then moved on to restraining them. I used the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618020250/http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm" target="_blank">Jakobsen method</a> for relaxing stick constraints for this, and though I once more must recommend checking out both PIKUMA's lessons as well as paper Jakobsen himself wrote on this, the concept is relatively simple. The constraint works by comparing two connected points with what their desired rest distance is, and then splitting the required correction between both points. For example, if the desired rest distance is 10, and yet the Verlet simulation has stretched this distance to 20, simply moving both points inwards by 5 will resolve it. There must be additional consideration for the possibility that one point is anchored and therefore cannot move, but that can be handled by just foisting the entire displacement onto the other non-anchored point.</p>

                            <div class="text-muted fst-italic mb-2 mt-2">An unstable rope. The first noticible disruption causes a chain reaction of over correction and incorrect estimations, leading to a rapidly devolving mess.</div>
                        </figure>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The above video is a very clear demonstration on why stability in a rope simulation is so important. Without strong stability, the individual points being simulated will begin to make wildly inaccurate estimations of the correct simulation. There are several ways to increase stability of a rope specifically: first, you can increase the number of times per update you calculate the "simulate, then restrain" phase that all points go through. Second, and not yet relevant to my own project, you can increase the mass of each rope point to dramatically improve things if the instability originally came from a mass dependent force (i.e. something weighing down on a rope). Another method is to enforce a strictly uniform delta time in your simulation; Unreal allows this via their method of "sub stepping" for physics in combination with configuring your object to update during the physics cycle.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Unfortunately, after doing what I could to stabilize the system using these methods, the previously shown instability remained. You may have noticed that in an above image, the points of the rope had fallen to rest perfectly on the floor - my issue was that I had been hoping to use Unreal's colliders as an easy solution to the stretch goal of allowing the rope to bend around corners without clipping. Each time I updated the positions of the rope points, the colliders were sweeping and colliding with not only the floor and wall but also many times with each other. So many calculations, done seperately from my own and often followed by an overcorrection to get away from multiple neighboring collider points, meant my system was highly unstable.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Removing the colliders drastically improved the stability of the system, so for now I have gone back to simply wishing to address rope collision as a stretch goal. If I get to it, it will certainly have to be done differently, likely with the same projection method that Jakobsen writtes about alongside his other soft body simulation techniques.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">However, even with this improvement, I was still unsatisfied with the general "messy" appearance of the rope. I ended up adding a stiffness modifier to the constraint section of the rope calculations, multiplying it into the calculation of how far off the stick is from rest position to further speed up the rope relaxation. The above videos show the before and after of this change.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The next step was to attach the player to the non-anchored side of the rope. This week included only the consideration of this from a grounded perspective, where the player can continue to walk around while holding the rope. Even with this limit, there were two parts to this problem. The first was easier - when the player moves closer or within the slack of the rope, the rope end must follow the player. It's enough to add another constraint during the "simulate and restrain" iteration that simply ties this point to the player. However, when the player reaches the end of a rope that has been stretched taut, the player can no longer drag the point in any which way and must instead be restrained by the rope themselves, unable to move past the length of the rope.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It is not enough to project the player back into the acceptable radius of locations on each update; doing so separate from the player movement controller creates a jittering effect as the player is rapidly moved from just outside the circle to just inside of it. To remove this jittering, I had to complete this restriction before the movement was ever applied. I did this in the character script where movement input is passed along to the controller. If the player is outside of the accepted radius of the rope and is moving even further away, I alter the movement input to instead push the player back into the acceptable radius.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">At this point, basic rope restraints have been implemented. However, the player cannot hang from a rope - the player restraints are only applicable to a grounded character. By next week, I plan on having this resolved. The player should be able to hang from a rope, and when the player falls on a rope the rope should display a muted bungee / elastic snapback effect.</p>
