                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This week, my goal was to make solid progress on resolving rope collisions with world geometry. I worked from simple geometry up to more complex cases - beginning with allowing the rope to rest on the floor, and then against flat walls, and then against curved walls and angled floors.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">My plan was to handle collisions the way I'd been handling moving the player through collisions when hanging: by just trying to project out of the collision at the goal destination. Of course, the rope points were a bit different from the player in that the rope points are not actors and don't have their own collision to check against, so I have to discover collisions myself with sphere casts. As such, the first problem is deciding the inputs for the sphere cast. It isn't as simple as just casting from the previous position to the current one. This is because the rope's movement doesn't always reflect a collision normal; in fact it very rarely does. You can see the problems this causes instantly, as this is the result when a cast is completed in this method right after rope creation - the rope wants to sway side to side as it settles, but with a sideways velocity, we end up resolving a largely parallel collision against the wall in front of us with a perpindicular cast and cause the points to get "corrected" into a position further to the side than is natural. </p>
                        <figure class="mb-4">
                            <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../assets/collideUseVelocity.png" alt="..." />
                            <div class="text-muted fst-italic mb-2 mt-2">The rope points being pulled to the side due to a raycast in the direction of their velocity.</div>
                        </figure>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">So if we can't use the velocity of the points as a raycast direction, we need a different way of figuring out the correct trace direction. We want this trace direction to be more or less in the direction of the normal of the thing we are colliding with, since raycasting in a direction significantly different from the normal would often find the collision point far sooner than is accurate...</p>
                        <figure class="mb-4">
                            <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../assets/collideCorrectionDiagram.png" alt="..." />
                            <div class="text-muted fst-italic mb-2 mt-2">A raycast downwards in two cases; it successfuly corrects a collision in the first case but fails when the collision normal is perpendicular to the raycast.</div>
                        </figure>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Luckily we can get a collision normal from Unreal's FHitResult, but it would be silly to conduct a raycast just to find a normal direction for a second, "correct" raycast. Thus, it would be best if that first raycast we made has the potential of being the correct one. This would be hard to predict for any world geometry that isn't the floor, which has a very constant normal of the global up vector (or at least a normal close to this), so that's what I decided to use as the first "test" raycast direction.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If the impact normal I get from that first downwards raycast is largely in the positive Z direction, I assume we're colliding with the floor and immediately jump to resolving the collision. Only if this majority Z direction check fails do I then take the impact normal and complete a second raycast in that direction, finding a correct impact point to resolve against.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I began resolving collisions simply by setting the position of the point to be the collision point rather than its calculated colliding location. This worked in the sense that it did keep the rope out of collisions, but it disrupted the rope enough it became unstable.</p>

                            <div class="text-muted fst-italic mb-2 mt-2">The rope staying out of collisions, but becoming unstable in the process - seen mostly with collision resolution against walls.</div>
                        </figure>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I tried to interleave the collision resolution with the restraint step, as that has been a recommended approach in some of the research I'd done earlier in the project, including Jakobsen's paper. However, for my own simulation, this only made this instability worse. Instead, I tried to resolve it at the source of the problem - projecting out of collisions was artificially creating odd velocity. This is because we get our velocity from our current position minus the previous one, and the current position is being directly altered by collision resolution. </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">There are two potential places to resolve unnatural velocity. One is within the step that a rope point actually calculates its velocity from the current and previous positions. The other is to directly modify the previous position alongside the current one. I tried first limiting the velocity during the velocity calculation step, but that caused problems elsewhere in the simulation. During initial rope construction and any time the rope changes sizes, the velocities of each point is significantly larger than is considered "resting" velocity, so limiting the velocity of the points universally caused these actions to happen as if they were moving through molasses. To resolve this, I alerted a point when it had experienced a collision, and only capped the calculated velocity on those frames. I did this with a collision count versus a boolean so that a single collision could impose the velocity cap for multiple frames.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">That maximum cap put on the calculated velocity resolved much of the instability, but the rope still moved too quickly in some instances. While that didn't always result in instabiltiy, it did always make it appear that the rope was being dragged on ice rather than a surface with friction. Using the second method of restricting velocity by directly setting the previous position to the same impact point that the current position is getting set to fixed this. Note that this couldn't completely replace the method of limiting the calculated velocity since it only affected a single frame, and the ability to limit for multiple frames after a collision helped with the stability of the rope enough to justify using both techniques.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Later I ended up coming back to this and changing the previous position to be close to the impact point but still with some small offset in the direction of the real previous position. This method, as opposed to just setting the previous position to the current one / the impact point, allowed for a bit more momentum to be kept even while keeping the appearance of friction in the system.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The next problem I had to tackle could be seen briefly in the above video on reduced instability - rope points would sometimes get stuck above or beside the anchor when the collisions were against a wall. This seemed to be an issue with curved surfaces specifically, as I couldn't replicate it on flat ones.</p>
                        <figure class="mb-4">

                        </figure>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When I visualized the normals in these instances, it was revealed that occasionally, for curved surfaces only, it was finding an impact normal that was pointed sideways almost parallel to the wall itself. This was happening because the collision of my "curved" object wasn't really curved - it was a hexagon. The rope point would happen to collide with an edge of the hexagon, and on the edge there would be a chance that the impact normal would read as if it expected the face it was an edge of to continue in the opposite direction.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I thought that I had a solution to this by simply moving the end point of the trace outwards from the object. I would take the impact normal and add a normalized vector representing the direction from the impacted object's position to the actual impact point. That direction vector would always point out away from the impacted wall, so it would shift the raytrace vector to never be so completely sideways against the wall. However, although this solved the problem with curved walls, this created unintended consequences with other objects. In particular, walls that were at an angle against the global axis couldn't handle this well - the tilted raytrace vector ended up hitting the wall and finding an impact point just barely offset from where the actual impact point should have been, which over many frames caused the rope to be yanked sideways.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I removed the adjustments I had made to the raycast vector to no longer take the extra offset so that this wasn't an issue anymore, but then of course the problem on curved walls came back. At this point, I had noticed that there was a secondary issue with rope points resolving wall collisions in odd positions, particularly getting stuck above the anchor without sideways adjustment, so I decided to step back from this issue to try something new with this other problem. </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For points getting stuck above the anchor, it seemed like the issue was that projecting out of a collision would sometimes put the point above where it would naturally be, which would normally be fine... except that I was also modifying the previous position and therefore the velocity in a way that made it difficult for the point to then naturally fall back down. To fix this, I didn't alter the previous position's Z position at all, and then also enforced a smaller Z position on the current position when a collision with a wall would unnaturally force the point upwards.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This alteration did have to be specified to only happen when the collision with a wall, though, or else points would sink straight into sloped floors:</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Luckily, this whole time I'd already been branching on whether the collision was with a wall or a floor since it was the basis of how we got out trace direction / normal vector from, so this was not a hard change to make.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This change also resolved the issue of points getting pulled sideways on curved walls, which very pleasantly surprised me. I believe that specifically allowing the previous position to retain its natural Z position is what fixed that, since just like with the points getting stuck above, it's alright if points briefly get pushed sideways so long as they can naturally fall back down into place.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">And, with all those issues solved, the basic implementation of rope collision against world geometry was completed!</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">However, I plan on saving this work for next week, as this felt like a natural point to break up the work. Since I wanted to make up my missing time from last week, though, I still had a some hours left of work for this week. I decided to use this time to look into optimization for this project.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Optimization is not something I've ever gone very far into before, especially not for large game engines such as Unreal. However, I felt it was increasingly important with this project, especially after this week's work. Previously, I only had raycasts on frames where something attached to the rope ran into something. Now, every single point on the rope has at least one raycast per frame on top of all the rest of the work. At the very least, I wanted to profile the system to see if this was becoming a problem.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I admittedly ended up having to spend far more time just trying to figure out how to use and comprehend the Unreal Insights application than I spent on any actual optimization efforts, but I'm glad I got the chance to look into the tool. Once I figured out how to read the information available to me, things looked pretty encouraging - for a packaged developmental build the average frame rate sits at about 95 FPS, and a single call running through the entire grapple system takes on average 8.5 μs. There are multiple calls to this system per frame since I had synched it to Unreal's physics loop back in the beginning of the project, but the most calls seen in a frame seems to be about 6, with the average being 4. Even on the one large frame dip I recorded, my grapple system was performing consistently and was not the cause of the dip. </p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">There didn't appear to be any obvious bottlenecks or issues with my code, but since I had spent so much time figuring out the Insights application, I wanted to try an optimization anyway to test comparing data. I only made small efforts - mostly just removing square roots where I could when considering vector lengths - but I completed several iterations of testing with the changes I made. I found that it could actually be fairly difficult to compare data sets across Insight logs due to the natural inconsistency across runs. I tried to complete the same basic actions in every run, but there would be natural inaccuracies in how many points are generated in a rope each run, or just how many rope points need to resolve collisions, or other such hard to replicate details that could affect profiling. I ended up just taking averages from several minutes of gameplay to try to reduce these issues, but I'm sure this was not a perfect effort.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Either way, the small changes I made did not make a noticible difference. The main cost sinks of the system are, after all, larger than square root calculations and have more to do with how many points and raycasts I complete each frame. I did not bother to pursue this further, though, since there weren't any performance issues and I wished to spend my time in places where my effort would have a more noticible impact.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Next week I'll continue where I left off on rope collisions, tackling the issue of ropes going around corners. This is the last major goal for this project, so if I continue to schedule, I'll be in a great place by the end of next week!</p>
