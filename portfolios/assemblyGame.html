                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This project was created as an educational exercise in register movement, raw memory management, and low level optimization.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Through this project, I became very familiar with variable and memory bit layouts and operations, as memory was very manually managed bit by bit and bit shifting was always preferred over multiplication when possible. Additionally, since there were no floating point registers available to me, fixed point arithmetic was required for calculations such as the acceleration and velocity of the moving game objects.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The most challenging part of this project was fighting to make the frames draw fast enough that there was no noticible lag. Drawing the entire background each frame was not feasible; although I had created a different routine for drawing the background BMP as opposed to all other BMPs for slight optimizations, it was still thousands of calls to set the color and draw.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I had to add the functionality to redraw only select portions of the background BMP based on the game object movement; this subroutine took the previous position of the foreground object and compared it to the current position in order to only draw only the pixels that were no longer covered by the new position of the foreground game object.</p>
