                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This system was developed for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/get-in-the-box-studios/about/" target="_blank">Get in the Box Studio's</a> project <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2297360/Deckweaver_Descent_Into_Chaos/" target="_blank"><i>Deckweaver: Descent into Chaos</i></a>, which is a deck building roguelite that released August 2023. In order to be as efficient in card creation as possible, we designed cards to be composite objects made of one or many modular pieces. These modular pieces hold the actual functionality of the ability associated with the card. Combined with the way most components had any number of configurations - either from component specific options or by combination with the elemental status system the game had - this allowed many more unique ability cards to be made than programmers had bandwidth for.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">An example of this modularity is as follows: a card may have a ranged base component with whatever projectile type is chosen, plus a headshot component that allows the ranged projectile to score headshots, plus a damage component to actually inflict the damage, plus a status application component that makes the ranged projectile stun any enemy it hits.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This is done by giving each card component a set of options on both when it activates and what sort of signals it is allowed to send. In the above example, the ranged base component would be told to trigger in the main use cycle of the card and be allowed to trigger damageable hit events. The headshot component, damage component, and status application component would all then be told to trigger only when this card receives a damageable hit event flag.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">On top of my contributions to the design of this system and the many card components I created, I also created the card useage pipeline. Cards are stored in decks, which exhibit all the normal cycling and shuffling functionality, etc. The player choosing to "use" a deck will use the top card of that deck, which in turn activates all the card components within that card appropriately.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For complete flexibilty, the time at which a card component is activated during the card use process can also be customized. In the previous example, the headshot component would be configured to activate when a hit caused by a different card component is reported, whereas the ranged base component would activate simply on card use.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Currently, <i>Deckweaver: Descent into Chaos</i> is being polished up in preparation for submission to IGF this year. The source code for this system will be made available afterwards, but please feel free to reach out to chat about it before then.</p>
