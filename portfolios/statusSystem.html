                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This system was developed for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/get-in-the-box-studios/about/" target="_blank">Get in the Box Studio's</a> project <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2297360/Deckweaver_Descent_Into_Chaos/" target="_blank"><i>Deckweaver: Descent into Chaos</i></a>, which is a deck building roguelite that released August 2023. Many of the card based abilities of the game involve status application or interaction, so the status system had to be flexible to allow for any number of combinations of effects.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Each status has the potential to have other status types that counter it (i.e. water countering fire), enhance it (i.e. water enhancing cold to create frozen), or create some sort of external effect (i.e. heat and poison creating an explosion). These interactions between statuses were built to be easily puzzle pieced together, so that new statuses could be created that interact in unique ways with the other statuses with no additional programmatic effort.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Beyond interactions with other statuses, each status also has the potential to affect the character it is applied to in numerous ways. For example, the affected character may generate block, have their speed altered, become stunned, or have a modifier applied to their outgoing damage amount.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Statuses also provide the opportunity to affect a character conditionally over time. For example, statuses give the option to continuously damage the character, or have the character continuously generate an AOE effect, or even have the character activate a card at a set interval. That last piece of functionality, continuous card activation, was used very frequently; for example, a 'minigun' card on the backend is actually a card that just applies a status to the player... but that status continuously activates a projectile based card every fraction of a second, to give the impression of a minigun. Other options for continuous status actions are to activate a status whenever a card is used, whenever the player does or receives damage, and more.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For any of the available continuous actions, action activation can be limited to only be successful if all of a specified list of conditions are met. These conditions could include requiring the character's health to be above or below a certain percent, or that the character has a certain status already applied to them, or that the character is actively attacking or being attacked.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Of course, with a system this flexible, statuses within the game quickly expanded out of being only elemental. One example is the case of the 'minigun' card discussed previously; other examples include passive effects such as simple speed boosts and temporary invincibility, or non-elemental preset statuses such as 'Thorns' which has the player continuously take damage in exchange for generating an AOE effect every time something external to the player does damage to them.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Adjacent to this system was a system of environmental status-based obstacles. These obstacles generally just applied a status to characters that entered them, such as a pond generating 'wet' statuses, but they also had the option to be configured to conduct various types of damage. For example, if a character is standing in a pond, and something with an electric status damage type hits another part of the pond, the pond will conduct that damage and status type to all the characters within it. Those characters, who are already wet from the pond, will then become stunned from the preset interaction of the wet and shocked statuses.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Currently, <i>Deckweaver: Descent into Chaos</i> is being polished up in preparation for submission to IGF this year. The source code for this system will be made available afterwards, but please feel free to reach out to chat about it before then.</p>
